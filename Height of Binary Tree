Given a binary tree, find its height.

The height of a tree is defined as the number of edges on the longest path from the root to a leaf node. A leaf node is a node that does not have any children.

class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to find the height of a binary tree.
    int height(Node* node) {
       
       if(node==NULL){
           return -1;
       }
      int leftht=height(node->left);
      int rightht=height(node->right);
       
       return max(leftht,rightht)+1;
    }
}
